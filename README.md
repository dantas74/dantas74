Software Architect
-------------------------

Hello! I'm a software architect that loves to learn everyday new things, I'm really into web development and OOP, and really love to code in TypeScript for web, but also in Python in data related things. Another thing that I really love is the DevOps culture, I apply it in my everyday duties to achieve most of customer success possible, doing integrations with AWS and the apps that I develop via Github Actions and Docker.
